# Studify, a GarudaHacks hackathon tale

## Inspiration
My team and I (the 3 of us) came up with this idea when we were struggling to organize our online classes links given by our lecturers at university, who constantly sends updates on new class links to our emails. Since it was a hassle to continuously search our emails and university forum pages for the class links, we came up with the idea to create a platform to organize and gather these online class links.

## What it does
The web application is really simple at this stage. It adds a new class to the student's schedule and allows students to join the class via a click of a button. It also allows students to delete and manage their classes, all in one whole page.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
We had so many ideas of what to implement, such as a teacher interface where teachers can choose to organize their online classes links and also update the class link for all students attending that class, and an attendance system that allows teachers to take online attendance when students join a class, and an alarm system to notify students of upcoming online classes. Initially we had 4 members in our team, the three of us and a person whom we invited from the team formation group in Slack. Most of the front-end for these ideas has already been implemented and ready to be used with the back-end. However, due to the limited time and one of our new team member with zero contribution and lack of communication when we entrusted our back-end to him/her, we struggled and rushed to learn how to implement the back-end using Firebase only in a few hours before the hackathon ends, since most of us are only familiar with front-end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team managed to implement some functionality of the project and also on time before the hackathon ends despite the sudden drastic change in skill level, a missing team member and amount of workload. We also had lots of fun building this application and worked tirelessly to deliver this project.

## What we learned
Our team learned lots of new skills along the way. While I have some experience in React, the other team members had to learn React and Firebase along the way. We have also developed teamwork, planning and communication skills while coding together as a team.

## What's next for Studify
If opportunity arises, our team would be delighted to continue development on this project to implement more exciting features. We believe that this application would help students and teachers to organize and manage their schedule during these struggling times where education has transitioned into online learning.
